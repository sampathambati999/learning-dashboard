      <p class="text-sm">Google Cloud offers a suite of tools that streamline the software delivery lifecycle through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Services like Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy, and Artifact Registry empower developers to build, test, and release software with minimal manual intervention. These tools integrate natively with GCP services like GKE, Cloud Run, and App Engine, making it easy to automate complex deployment workflows and enforce consistent build environments.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">Using Cloud Build, developers can define build steps in a YAML configuration file and trigger builds from code repositories such as GitHub or Cloud Source Repositories. Cloud Deploy supports progressive rollouts, traffic splitting, and rollback strategies, which help ensure safe releases. Together with Artifact Registry, which stores Docker images and other artifacts securely, these tools create a robust CI/CD pipeline that enhances speed, reliability, and security in application delivery.</p>
