      Informatica PowerCenter is a high-performance data integration platform used widely for building enterprise data warehouses and managing data pipelines. It enables ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations by connecting to various source systems (databases, flat files, mainframes), applying business logic and transformations, and loading into target systems such as relational databases or file repositories.<br><br>

<b>Designer:</b> The Designer is the core development environment where data mappings are created. Developers define source and target definitions, create reusable transformations, and design mapping logic that governs how data flows and is transformed between systems.<br><br>

<b>Workflow Manager:</b> This component is used to design and configure workflows, which are sequences of sessions and tasks that execute mappings. It supports linking multiple sessions together with decision conditions, event triggers, and task dependencies.<br><br>

<b>Repository Manager:</b> Used primarily for managing folders, versions, user permissions, and metadata in the repository database. It allows you to import/export objects and organize them in a structured and secure manner.<br><br>

<b>Monitor:</b> The Monitor interface provides real-time tracking and logging of workflows and sessions. You can view status, row-level statistics, session logs, and diagnose failures using this monitoring dashboard.</p>
