    <!-- BigQuery -->
    <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">ðŸ“Š BigQuery</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">BigQuery is Google's fully managed, serverless, and highly scalable data warehouse that allows users to analyze massive datasets using SQL. It is designed for rapid SQL queries over large datasets and is optimized for real-time analytics. BigQuery separates compute and storage, allowing users to scale each independently, which leads to better performance and cost optimization.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">BigQuery supports features like partitioned and clustered tables for better query efficiency. Users can run federated queries across data sources like Cloud Storage, Google Sheets, and Bigtable without needing to move the data. It also integrates with tools like Data Studio and Looker for visualization.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">With BigQuery ML, users can train and deploy machine learning models directly within BigQuery using simple SQL syntax. Combined with built-in security, fine-grained IAM, and detailed audit logging, BigQuery becomes a powerful tool for enterprises dealing with real-time analytics and big data processing.</p>

    <!-- Pub/Sub -->
    <div class="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">ðŸ”” Pub/Sub</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">Cloud Pub/Sub is a messaging service for exchanging event data among services and applications. It supports asynchronous messaging between independent systems using the publisher-subscriber pattern, where messages are published to a topic and received by subscribers.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">It is designed to provide low-latency and durable messaging at scale. Pub/Sub automatically scales based on throughput and supports exactly-once delivery when integrated with Pub/Sub Lite. This makes it ideal for decoupling systems and building event-driven architectures.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">Use cases for Pub/Sub include streaming analytics, log ingestion, data replication, IoT telemetry, and integrating microservices. It works well with services like Cloud Functions, Dataflow, and Cloud Run to build reactive systems.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Dataflow -->
    <div class="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">ðŸ”„ Dataflow</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed stream and batch processing service based on Apache Beam. It enables you to create unified pipelines that process real-time or historical data with automatic scaling and parallel execution.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">With Dataflow, users can build robust ETL pipelines to ingest, clean, transform, and analyze data. It supports seamless integration with BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Storage, making it a preferred choice for data engineering workflows.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">Dataflow also provides windowing, session analysis, and event-time processing for real-time use cases. Built-in monitoring, autoscaling, and integration with Vertex AI pipelines make it powerful for production-grade applications.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Dataproc -->
    <div class="border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-4">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">ðŸ§  Dataproc</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">Cloud Dataproc is a managed Spark and Hadoop service on GCP that allows you to process big data using familiar open-source tools. It simplifies the process of creating clusters, running jobs, and shutting them down to save costs.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">Dataproc supports batch, streaming, and interactive workloads with the ability to scale clusters up or down quickly. It integrates well with Cloud Storage (as a data lake), BigQuery, and other GCP services to streamline data workflows.</p>
      <p class="text-sm">It is ideal for organizations migrating from on-prem Hadoop environments or those running Spark-based machine learning and data processing tasks. With custom initialization scripts and optional Jupyter notebook integrations, it also supports data scientists and analysts effectively.</p>
