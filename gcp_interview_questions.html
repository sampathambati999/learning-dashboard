      <div><strong>11. How does Cloud Build work?</strong><br>Executes build steps defined in a config file, integrates with source code repositories.</div>
      <div><strong>12. What is Artifact Registry?</strong><br>Stores container images and other build artifacts securely.</div>
      <div><strong>13. Difference between zonal and regional resources?</strong><br>Zonal are confined to a single zone; regional are replicated across multiple zones.</div>
      <div><strong>14. What is Cloud Function?</strong><br>A lightweight, event-driven serverless compute service.</div>
      <div><strong>15. Explain Dataflow.</strong><br>A managed Apache Beam service for stream and batch data processing.</div>
      <div><strong>16. What is Cloud Run?</strong><br>Serverless platform to run containers triggered by HTTP requests or events.</div>
      <div><strong>17. What is GKE?</strong><br>Managed Kubernetes engine for container orchestration.</div>
      <div><strong>18. What is Preemptible VM?</strong><br>Low-cost VM that can be shut down at any time.</div>
      <div><strong>19. Explain the Shared VPC concept.</strong><br>Allows multiple projects to use a common network from a host project.</div>
      <div><strong>20. What is Cloud Spanner?</strong><br>Globally distributed relational database with high availability and consistency.</div>
      <div><strong>21. How does Cloud Monitoring help?</strong><br>Tracks metrics, uptime, and provides dashboards for system observability.</div>
      <div><strong>22. What is a Service Perimeter?</strong><br>Used in VPC Service Controls to define a secure boundary around services.</div>
      <div><strong>23. What is a Stackdriver Logging?</strong><br>Collects logs from GCP services for monitoring and auditing.</div>
      <div><strong>24. Difference between Cloud SQL and Firestore?</strong><br>Cloud SQL is relational; Firestore is NoSQL document-based.</div>
      <div><strong>25. How does autoscaling work in Compute Engine?</strong><br>Automatically adds/removes VMs based on load or custom metrics.</div>
      <div><strong>26. What is Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)?</strong><br>Controls access to web applications based on IAM policies and identity.</div>
      <div><strong>27. Can GCP connect to on-prem systems?</strong><br>Yes, via VPN, Interconnect, or Transfer Appliance.</div>
      <div><strong>28. What is billing account in GCP?</strong><br>Centralized account used to pay for usage across multiple projects.</div>
